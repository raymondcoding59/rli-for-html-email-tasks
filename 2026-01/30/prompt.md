Convert this email design into a pixel-perfect HTML email that is compatible with all email clients, mobile-responsive, and dark-mode compatible. 

Adhere to the following instructions:
- Use placehold.co image placeholders for all images and icons (with .png image type).

- Do not infer or reinterpret element colours or background colours based on visual perception; extract RGB values of each element directly from the image, then use the equivalent hex code for the element.

- Ensure all elements and copy in the design are used word for word and exactly as they appear in the design without adding, removing or modifying anything(except for placeholder images and icons)

- ensure the formatting of all text elements is preserved exactly as they are in the design

- Ensure that the proportions of the images and icons are preserved exactly as they are in the design
